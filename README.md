# Tech Blog

## Description

This repo contains the content for module 14

- As a developer who writes about tech, I wanted a CMS-style blog site
so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
- The application allows a user to create an account, make blog posts, and comment on other users blog posts.
- I learned more about about routes, models, and handlebars.

## Installation

## Usage

When a user first opens the page, they are greeted by the homepage. From there, they can click login button located on the navbar, and either login, or sign up if they are a new user. Once they are logged in, they are free to join the discussion! Just click on another users post to share your thoughts.
